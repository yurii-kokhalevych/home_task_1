        <h1><i>Mountain</i></h1>
        <hr>
        <p>A mountain is a large landform that stretches above the surrounding 
        land in a limited area, usually in the form of a peak. A mountain is 
        generally steeper than a hill. Mountains are formed through tectonic 
        forces or volcanism. These forces can locally raise the surface of the 
        earth. Mountains erode slowly through the action of rivers, weather 
        conditions, and glaciers. A few mountains are isolated summits, but 
        most occur in huge mountain ranges.<br> High elevations on mountains
        produce colder climates than at sea level. These colder climates 
        strongly affect the ecosystems of mountains: different elevations 
        have different plants and animals. Because of the less hospitable 
        terrain and climate, mountains tend to be used less for agriculture 
        and more for resource extraction and recreation, such as mountain 
        climbing.<br> The <strong>highest mountain</strong> on Earth is Mount Everest in the 
        <b>Himalayas of Asia</b>, whose summit is 8,850 m <small>(29,035 ft)</small> above mean sea 
        level. The highest known mountain on any planet in the Solar System is 
        <em>Olympus Mons on Mars</em> at 21,171 m <small>(69,459 ft)</small>.</p>

        <p>There are three <mark> types of mountains</mark>: <wbr> volcanic, fold, and block.<wbr>
        All three types are formed from plate tectonics: when portions of the 
        Earth's crust move, crumple, and dive. Compressional forces, isostatic 
        uplift and intrusion of igneous matter forces surface rock upward, 
        creating a landform higher than the surrounding features. The height of 
        the feature makes it either a hill or, if higher and steeper, a mountain. 
        Major mountains tend to occur in long linear arcs, indicating tectonic 
        plate boundaries and activity.</p>
